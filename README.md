This bug demonstrates a common issue in TypeScript's type system when dealing with conditional logic and function return types. The function `printNumber` has a void return type, but the `else` block in the main logic attempts to call `printNumber` with 0, which leads to the TypeScript compiler error: Type '0' is not assignable to type 'never'.

This is because the original code implies that the `else` block should never be executed due to the prior conditional check, and thus a void return is considered safe. However, this is not always guaranteed. If the conditional statement is altered or if there are external factors impacting the variable value, the else block could become reachable. Therefore, the TypeScript compiler enforces the void return, which is incompatible with the literal value 0 being passed to the function.
