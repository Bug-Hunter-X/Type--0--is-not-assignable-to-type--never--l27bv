//This is because the original code implies that the else block should never be executed due to the prior conditional check, and thus a void return is considered safe. However, this is not always guaranteed. If the conditional statement is altered or if there are external factors impacting the variable value, the else block could become reachable. Therefore, the TypeScript compiler enforces the void return, which is incompatible with the literal value 0 being passed to the function. 
//Solution: remove the void return type to allow for the case where num is not in range.
//A more robust solution would involve changing the logic such that the else block does not require sending a number to printNumber. For example, the else block could simply do nothing or log a different message.
